# Oasis-infobyte-Data-Science-Internship
Oasis infobyte - Data Science Internship Tasks ( Feb - 2024 Batch) 
This internship focused on data science and analytics. I applied for this internship via Oasis Infobyte's website. I fulfilled all of the responsibilities assigned to me by them. They have assigned five tasks. The explanation of each task is given below:
Task 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION I estimated the species of IRIS Flower based on the supplied qualities, which included petal length, sepal length, petal width, and sepal width. I utilized Decision Tree classification (ID3 Classifier) to classify the species.

Task 2: Unemployment Analysis I studied the dataset by making several charts and graphs for unemployment analysis using Python's matplotlib and seaborn packages.

TASK 3: CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING The price of an automobile is determined by a variety of criteria, including the brand's reputation, the car's features, its horoscope, and the mileage it provides, among others. Car price prediction is an important study field in machine learning. So, if you want to know how to teach a vehicle price

Task 4: EMAIL SPAM DETECTION We've all received spam emails before. Spam mail, often known as junk mail, is a sort of email that is sent to a large number of people at once, sometimes containing cryptic messages, scams, or, more dangerously, phishing material. In this project, we will use Python to create an email spam detector. The spam detector should then be trained using machine learning to recognize and categorize emails as spam or not spam.

Task 5: SALES PREDICTION. Sales prediction is the process of projecting how much of a product people will buy based on criteria such as the amount of money you spend promoting your product, the demographics of the people you market to, and the platform you use to sell your product. Typically, a product or service-based corporation need its Data Scientist to forecast future sales with every action they take to influence the cost of promoting their product. The goal of predicting sales using machine learning was completed in Python.I utilized a linear regression model to anticipate sales.
