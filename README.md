# Oasis-infobyte-Data-Science-Internship
Oasis infobyte - Data Science Internship Tasks ( Feb - 2024 Batch) 
This internship focused on data science and analytics. I applied for this internship via Oasis Infobyte's website. I fulfilled all of the responsibilities assigned to me by them. They have assigned five tasks. The explanation of each task is given below:
Task 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION I estimated the species of IRIS Flower based on the supplied qualities, which included petal length, sepal length, petal width, and sepal width. I utilized Decision Tree classification (ID3 Classifier) to classify the species.

Task-2: Unemployment Analysis I studied the dataset by making several charts and graphs for unemployment analysis using Python's matplotlib and seaborn packages.

TASK-3: CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING The price of an automobile is determined by a variety of criteria, including the brand's reputation, the car's features, its horoscope, and the mileage it provides, among others. Car price prediction is an important study field in machine learning. So, if you want to know how to teach a vehicle price
Task-4: EMAIL SPAM DETECTION We have all been the recipient of spam mails before. Spam mail,or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams ,or most dangerously, phishing content. In this project , we use Python to build an email spam detector. Then use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.

Task-5: SALES PREDICTION Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. The task of sales prediction with machine learning id done using python.I used linear regression model for forecasting the sales.
