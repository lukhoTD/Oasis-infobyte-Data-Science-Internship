Iris Flower Classification
The Iris flower data set, often known as Fisher's Iris data set, is a well-known multivariate data set that is used to test various machine learning algorithms.There are three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differ in their dimensions. Assume you have measurements of iris blooms categorized by species, and your job is to create a machine learning model that can learn from and classify the iris species.

**Based on measurements of Sepal Width, Sepal Length, Petal Length, and Petal Width from all three categories. We need to classify them depending on their measurements.
Steps
**1. Importing requried libraries
2. Loading of dataset
3. Display Summary Statistics
4. Data Visualization
4.1 Histograms(Uniariate analysis)
4.2 Scatter plots to visualize relation between variables(bivariate analysis)
4.3 Pair plots(Multivariate analysis)
4.4 Correlation matrix
5. Data Modelling
5.1 Train-Test-Split
5.2 Decision Tree classification(ID3 Classifier)
5.3 Confusion matrix
5.4 Model and accuracy sore
6. Prediction of species

Step 1:Importing requried libraries
#imported required libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

step 2:Loading Dataset
#loading dataset
df = pd.read_csv('IRIS.csv')
df

df - pd.csv('IRIS.csv')
